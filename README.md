### Project Description
The AI-Based Travel Planner and Guide project generates personalized travel itineraries based on user preferences, such as destination, interests, and time frame. It uses the LLaMA 2 model to suggest activities, recommend sightseeing spots, and provide essential travel information. The interface, built with Gradio in Google Colab, allows users to interact easily and adjust their itinerary preferences. Additionally, it suggests a random fun activity to add an extra layer of excitement to the travel plans.
